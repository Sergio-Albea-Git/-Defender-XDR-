Statuscode, type, description, Possible_Threat
100, Continue,The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body,May be used to probe server behavior or perform reconnaissance on how a server handles requests
101, Switching Protocols,The requester has asked the server to switch protocols, Upgrading the connectionsu ch as to WebSockets could be exploited to bypass certain security checks or firewall rules
103, Early Hints,Used with the Link header to allow the browser to start preloading resources while the server prepares a response, Attackers could use the 103 status code to pre-load malicious resources (e.g. JavaScript or CSS) on a phishing page. This technique could make the phishing page appear more legitimate by pre-loading content that matches the look and feel of a legitimate site.
200, OK,The request is OK (this is the standard response for successful HTTP requests), Although a success code if seen in unexpected contexts (e.g. following unusual access patterns) it may indicate successful exploitation or access to sensitive information.
201, Created,The request has been fulfilled and a new resource is created , 
202, Accepted,The request has been accepted for processing but the processing has not been completed, If an application accepts a request and returns a 202 status code but defers the actual processing; there is a risk that the request could be tampered with or manipulated before the processing completes.
203, Non-Authoritative Information,The request has been successfully processed but is returning information that may be from another source, A malicious proxy could modify the content of the response before it reaches the client potentially injecting malicious code / altering content / or stripping out important information such as security headers.
204, No Content,The request has been successfully processed but is not returning any content, Could be used in a covert channel as no content is returned which might be an attempt to communicate with a compromised system without leaving a large footprint
205, Reset Content,The request has been successfully processed but is not returning any content and requires that the requester reset the document view, A phishing attack could potentially abuse the 205 Reset Content status to reset a form after a user submits sensitive information; prompting them to re-enter the data. The attacker could then capture this information without the user realizing it was already submitted.
206, Partial Content,The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client, Range requests can be abused in DDoS attacks; where attackers flood a server with multiple partial content requests overwhelming the server’s resources.
300, Multiple Choices,A link list. The user can select a link and go to that location. Maximum five addresses, Attackers could use 301 redirects to hijack legitimate traffic and send it to malicious sites, potentially affecting search engine rankings.
301, Moved Permanently,The requested page has moved to a new URL, could be used for phishing by redirecting users to malicious sites. Persistent redirections might indicate an attempt to manipulate traffic flows.
302, Found,The requested page has moved temporarily to a new URL, An attacker could use a 302 redirect to temporarily redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious one where phishing pages are hosted. This can be used to steal credentials / personal information or payment details.
303, See Other,The requested page can be found under a different URL, An attacker may exploit open redirect vulnerabilities where a 303 status code redirects users to a malicious site.
304, Not Modified,Indicates the requested page has not been modified since last requested,
307, Temporary Redirect,The requested page has moved temporarily to a new URL, similar to 301/302 but with method preservation. These could be used to redirect legitimate traffic to malicious destinations.
308, Permanent Redirect,The requested page has moved permanently to a new URL, Attackers could use 308 redirects to direct users from a legitimate-looking URL to a malicious one. This tactic can be used in phishing campaigns to deceive users into believing they are accessing a legitimate site.
400, Bad Request,The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax, May indicate malformed requests possibly from automated tools or scanners probing for weaknesses.
401, Unauthorized,The request was a legal request but the server is refusing to respond to it. For use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided, Repeated 401 errors might indicate brute force attempts or credential stuffing attacks.
402, Payment Required,Reserved for future use, An attacker could use the 402 Payment Required status in phishing scams by creating a fake payment page that uses this status code to make the request seem legitimate.
403, Forbidden,The request was a legal request but the server is refusing to respond to it, Continuous 403 responses could suggest an attacker is probing restricted areas of a site or application.
404, Not Found,The requested page could not be found but may be available again in the future, High volume of 404 errors could indicate a reconnaissance attempt to discover unprotected files or outdated vulnerable scripts.
405, Method Not Allowed,A request was made of a page using a request method not supported by that page,
406, Not Acceptable,The server can only generate a response that is not accepted by the client,
407, Proxy Authentication Required,The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy, Attackers might attempt to steal credentials by setting up a malicious proxy that requires authentication (triggering a 407 response) and then logging the credentials that users input.
408, Request Timeout,The server timed out waiting for the request, Attackers might deliberately send incomplete requests or flood the server with connections that never complete causing the server to timeout these requests. This could overwhelm the server making it unavailable to legitimate users.
409, Conflict,The request could not be completed because of a conflict in the request, Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that cause conflicts. For example exploiting race conditions improper data handling or concurrency issues might result in a 409 Conflict error.
410, Gone,The requested page is no longer available, Attackers may intentionally remove phishing sites / malicious files or other harmful content to evade detection after their initial use.
411, Length Required,The Content-Length is not defined. The server will not accept the request without it,Attackers may send incomplete or malformed requests to probe the server's behavior potentially as a precursor to more targeted attacks like SQL injection or command injection.
412, Precondition Failed,The precondition given in the request evaluated to false by the server,
413, Request Too Large,The server will not accept the request because the request entity is too large,
414, Request-URI Too Long,The server will not accept the request because the URI is too long. Occurs when you convert a POST request to a GET request with a long query information,
415, Unsupported Media Type,The server will not accept the request because the media type is not supported,
416, Range Not Satisfiable,The client has asked for a portion of the file but the server cannot supply that portion,
417, Expectation Failed,The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field,
500, Internal Server Error,A generic error message given when no more specific message is suitable, Persistent 500 errors may indicate that an attacker is trying to exploit server-side vulnerabilities like SQL injection or buffer overflows.
501, Not Implemented,The server either does not recognize the request method or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request,
502, Bad Gateway,The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server, Could indicate misconfiguration or even be a sign of an ongoing attack such as a DoS attack against an upstream server.
503, Service Unavailable,The server is currently unavailable (overloaded or down), Often linked to server overloads. Repeated instances might point to a DoS or DDoS attack. It could also indicate an attacker attempting to take a service offline.
504, Gateway Timeout,The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server, This can signal network latency issues or that an attacker is deliberately trying to cause slowdowns in the communication between systems.
505, HTTP Version Not Supported,The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request, May be used by attackers to test server configurations and behavior with unsupported or deprecated HTTP versions.
511, Network Authentication Required,The client needs to authenticate to gain network access,
